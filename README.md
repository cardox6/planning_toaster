# planning_toaster

Your Task: Write a planning algorithm for making toast!

Please use the attached python file. It contains states, actions, state transition function and goal function al prepared for you. You get to write a planning function.

The task comes in multiple difficulties:
- (Simple) Look over the file, understand how the formal setup of the planning problem has been implemented in Python.
- (Medium) Implement breadth first search (you may refer to the pseudo code).
- (Hard) find the plan that toasts bread the fastest by finding a solution where parameter "time" is minimal.
- (Very-Hard) Solve the hard task with an algorithm that needs as little run time as possible.
